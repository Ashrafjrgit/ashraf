        <p><h1>Alcohol Abuse</h1>
            <h2>Alcohol and its effects</h2> 
            Alcohol is a depressant that affects concentration and coordination, slowing reaction times and affecting responses to situations, hence the danger when engaging in activities such as driving, working or sport.
            In order to fully understand the consequences of drinking, you should first know what constitutes as a drink. A standard drink measures the amount of pure alcohol you are drinking.
            Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) 
            Drinking has different effects on different people, depending on their weight, sex and metabolism and can be influenced by a number of risk factors such as the amount consumed, an individual's medical history, and tolerance to alcohol, as well as other drugs – legal or illegal – mixed with alcohol.
            A person’s blood alcohol content (BAC) determines the effect of alcohol on the central nervous system. Those who have built up a tolerance to alcohol can drink more than those with a lower tolerance level.
            Depending on your BAC, you can experience an array of side effects that range from minor complications to more severe ones. For example, lower BAC percentages tend to come with temporary side effects that subside within a few hours. However, as BAC percentages increase, the symptoms become much more serious and can be life-threatening.
            
            
            
            <h2> how alcohol abuse effects parts of the body </h2>
            Alcohol abuse can affect your body both inside and out. Even though you’re unable to see the damage drinking causes to your internal organs, it’s important not to ignore the warning signs of alcoholism. Sometimes the harmful effects aren’t discovered until much later in life, making it difficult to reverse many health complications.
            While the short-term effects, such as lack of coordination, mood changes and nausea are well known, the long-term effects on the body of prolonged and/or excessive drinking can include:
            •	Loss of feeling in hands and feet. <br>
            •	Brain damage. <br>
            •	Loss of memory. <br>
            •	Hallucinations. <br>
            •	Confusion. <br>
            •	High blood pressure. <br>
            •	Enlarged heart. <br>
            •	Irregular pulse. <br>
            •	Increased risk of infections including tuberculosis, cirrhosis of the liver, hepatitis, increased cancer risk, bleeding, ulcers and muscle weakness. <br>
            <h3>For men</h3>
            •	Impotence. <br>
            •	Shrinking of testicles. <br>
            •	Sperm damage and lower sperm count. <br>
             <h3>For women:</h3>
            •	Increased gynaecological problems. <br> 
            •	Foetus damage if pregnant. <br>
            •	Increased risk of breast cancer. <br> <br>
            While every organ in your body can feel the effects from drinking, some are more at risk for extensive damage. The best way to prevent health issues now and in the future is to quit drinking with the help of a professional treatment program.
             <h3>Brain</h3>
            Alcohol’s effects on the brain can be felt quickly. Not only can drinking cause temporary complications such as memory loss and coordination, it can also lead to long-term side effects that are sometimes irreversible.
            Prolonged and excessive alcohol use can interfere with how the brain functions, as well as how it’s structured. Damage to different regions of the brain, especially the cerebellum, limbic system and cerebral cortex, can significantly impact the body’s communication pathways. For example, the cerebellum handles your body’s motor skills. When alcohol affects this area of the brain, you’re more likely to experience a loss of balance, as well as memory and emotional response issues.
             <h3>Heart</h3>
            The heart is extremely vulnerable to the negative effects of alcohol consumption. Over time, heavy drinking can weaken the heart, impacting how oxygen and nutrients are delivered to other vital organs in your body. Excessive alcohol consumption can increase triglyceride levels – a type of fat in your blood. High levels of triglycerides contribute to the risk of developing dangerous health conditions such as heart disease and diabetes.
            Some of the early cardiovascular effects, like high blood pressure and an irregular heartbeat, can lead to a host of problems down the road. Long-term consequences of excessive drinking may include cardiomyopathy, stroke and sudden cardiac death.
             <h3>Liver</h3>
            Heavy drinkers are at risk of harmful, potentially life-threatening liver problems. When you drink, your liver breaks down alcohol and removes it from your blood. However, too much alcohol in a short period of time can overwhelm the metabolism process and lead to fatty liver. Fatty liver is a chronic condition that involves the buildup of bad fats in the liver. Obesity is one of the biggest factors of fatty liver. It can also cause liver failure and type 2 diabetes.
            Other serious liver complications associated with prolonged and excessive alcohol consumption are alcoholic hepatitis, fibrosis and cirrhosis. While each of these conditions is treatable, they require a proper medical diagnosis and intensive treatment plan.
             <h3>Pancreas</h3>
            The pancreas is part of the digestive process and helps regulate your body’s blood sugar levels. Drinking alcohol over many years can start to negatively impact your pancreas and cause lasting health complications. Unfortunately, the early stages of many pancreatic conditions are often unfelt and therefore, left untreated.
            Long-term alcohol abuse can eventually cause the blood vessels around the pancreas to swell, leading to pancreatitis. This greatly increases your risk of developing pancreatic cancer – a type of cancer that spreads rapidly and is very dangerous. Symptoms of an acute pancreatic attack may include abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea, fast heart rate and fever. While medications and other treatment methods can help manage the effects of pancreatitis, it is very difficult to reverse the condition.
            Alcohol poisoning 
            Too much alcohol consumed in a short period of time can slow your breathing and heart rate, lower your body temperature, and cause confusion, vomiting, seizures, unconsciousness, and even death. Alcohol poisoning can also suppress your gag reflex, increasing the risk that you will choke on your own vomit if you pass out.
            If a person has been binge drinking and is unconscious or semiconscious, their breathing is slow, their skin is clammy, and there is a strong odor of alcohol, they may have alcohol poisoning.
           <br> <br> •	Don’t leave them alone to “sleep it off.” <br> <br>
            •	If the person vomits, turn them onto their side to avoid choking. <br> <br>
            •	Call 111 and wait with them for medical help to arrive. <br> <br>
             <h2>Common myths about alcoholism</h2>
             <h3>Myth: I can stop drinking whenever I want</h3>
            <h3>Fact</h3>: You might be able to; more likely, you won't be able to. In any case, it's just another reason to keep drinking. To be honest, you don't want to stop. Telling yourself you can quit gives you a sense of control, despite all evidence to the contrary and regardless of the harm it is causing.
           <h3> Myth</h3>: My drinking is my problem. No one has the authority to tell me to stop because I am the one who is being hurt.
            It is true that the decision to stop drinking is entirely up to you. But you are deceiving yourself if you believe that your drinking only harms you. Everyone around you is affected by alcoholism, especially those closest to you. Their problem is your problem.
            <h3>Myth</h3>: I’m not an alcoholic because I have a job and I’m doing okay.
            <h3>Fact</h3>: Being an alcoholic does not necessitate being homeless and drinking from a brown paper bag. Many alcoholics are able to work, attend school, and provide for their families. Some are even capable of excelling. However, just because you're a high-functioning alcoholic doesn't mean you're not endangering yourself or others. The consequences will eventually catch up with you.
            <h3>Myth</h3>: Unlike drug abuse, drinking is not a "real" addiction.
            Alcohol is a drug, and alcoholism is just as harmful as drug addiction. Alcohol addiction alters the body and brain, and long-term alcohol abuse can be detrimental to your health, career, and relationships. When alcoholics stop drinking, they experience physical withdrawal, just as drug users do when they stop using.
